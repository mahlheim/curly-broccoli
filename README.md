## Description
Furever Home is an interactive website that allows a user to browse available cats and dogs for adoption at three different Furever Home locations. This application was made possible through the use of Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, Google Fonts, MySQL, and the Sequelize ORM. It was created using the MVC paradigm and includes authentication via express-session. 

## Installation
You can clone the repository to your local machine, install the dependencies and run the app locally or, for ease, the app can also be accessed [here](https://fathomless-shore-00999-99874d90faa8.herokuapp.com/) via heroku!

## Usage
Navigate to the homepage and select the location you would like to view. You will be prompted to login or create an account. Once signed in, you can view the available animals and their data (including names, breeds, weights, coat colors, and arrival dates) as well as their image. Each location will list their opening and closing times so that you can plan a trip to adopt your new pet and give them their new Furever Home!
